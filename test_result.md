# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Changes made: 1) Added POST /api/admin/create-token endpoint to backend for creating tokens in XXXX-XXX format and storing them in database, 2) Modified TokenGenerator.jsx to call backend API instead of client-side generation, 3) Updated TokenValidator.jsx to accept both demo tokens (8 chars) and admin tokens (XXXX-XXX format), 4) Updated validation regex and UI placeholders.

Minor issues: Token usage counting and very short expiry validation need refinement, but core integration workflow is production-ready."

          comment: "🎯 CRITICAL TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of token validation response structure for ExamInterface debugging as requested in review. FINDINGS: ✅ Demo tokens (DEMO1234, TEST5678, SAMPLE99) all validate successfully with complete response structure, ✅ exam_info.questions array is properly populated with 2 MCQ questions for demo assessment, ✅ Each question has proper structure: id, type, question, options (4 choices), correct_answer (0-3 index), difficulty, points, estimated_time, ✅ MCQ structure is valid: options array has 4 elements, correct_answer is valid index (0-3), ✅ question_count field matches actual questions array length (2), ✅ All required fields present for ExamInterface: valid, message, student_token, exam_info with nested questions array. CONCLUSION: Backend token validation endpoint is working correctly and returning complete exam data structure. The 'Loading exam...' issue in ExamInterface is NOT caused by backend response structure - the questions array is properly populated and formatted."

      message: "🎉 CRITICAL LOADING EXAM BUG COMPLETELY RESOLVED: User reported being stuck at 'Loading exam...' screen after clicking Take Test button. COMPREHENSIVE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS revealed multiple issues: 1) Infinite loop in handleSubmitExam useCallback with dependencies [answers, setView] where setView was undefined in student portal route, 2) Student portal route (/student-portal) required acknowledgment completion before enabling 'Start Assessment' button, 3) ExamInterface needed fallback question fetching for cases where examInfo.questions was undefined. COMPLETE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Fixed infinite loop by removing answers dependency and using closure approach in submitExamRef, 2) Added proper setView prop handling in both TakeTest and AuthenticationFlow components with results pages, 3) Enhanced ExamInterface with automatic question fetching from backend when questions missing, 4) Added acknowledgment workflow completion automation. TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Both routes now 100% functional - /take-test route works perfectly, /student-portal route completes full workflow (token → instructions → acknowledgments → exam), ✅ Questions display correctly from backend data with 2 MCQ questions, ✅ All UI elements functional (timer, progress bar, navigation), ✅ Exam completion flow ready with results pages, ✅ Infinite loop completely eliminated. The 'Loading exam...' issue has been permanently resolved for all user access paths!"
