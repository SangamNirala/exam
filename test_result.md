# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Changes made: 1) Added POST /api/admin/create-token endpoint to backend for creating tokens in XXXX-XXX format and storing them in database, 2) Modified TokenGenerator.jsx to call backend API instead of client-side generation, 3) Updated TokenValidator.jsx to accept both demo tokens (8 chars) and admin tokens (XXXX-XXX format), 4) Updated validation regex and UI placeholders. Tested successfully: Admin tokens like H4YB-6LH and AT5D-PYR now validate correctly and link to actual exams."

      message: "🔍 FRONTEND AI QUESTION GENERATION WORKFLOW TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete AI question generation workflow in the frontend. RESULTS: ✅ Admin dashboard access and authentication working perfectly. ✅ Exam creation wizard successfully initiated and navigated through all steps. ✅ Basic information form (title, description, duration) working correctly. ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: 1) MCQ exam type selection requires user to click on the Multiple Choice Questions card - this step is not intuitive and needs better UX guidance. 2) Document upload functionality is NOT WORKING - no file input field found on the document upload step, preventing users from uploading PDFs for AI processing. 3) Without document upload, AI question generation cannot be tested end-to-end. RECOMMENDATION: Fix document upload UI component in Step 4 of the exam creation wizard to enable the complete AI workflow."

      message: "🔐 STUDENT PORTAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of all new authentication endpoints completed with 100% success rate (35/35 tests passed). RESULTS: ✅ Demo Token Creation (POST /api/student/create-demo-token) - Creates demo assessment and 3 tokens (DEMO1234, TEST5678, SAMPLE99) perfectly. ✅ Token Validation (POST /api/student/validate-token) - All valid tokens validated successfully, invalid tokens properly rejected with helpful error messages. ✅ Face Verification (POST /api/student/face-verification) - Processes base64 images with confidence scoring (0.86 achieved), creates exam sessions, handles errors gracefully. ✅ Database Integration - All collections (student_tokens, assessments, exam_sessions) created and populated correctly. ✅ Error Handling - All endpoints handle missing parameters (422 status), invalid tokens (400 status), and malformed data appropriately. The Student Portal Authentication System backend is fully functional and ready for frontend integration."

      message: "🎯 FACE VERIFICATION REMOVAL REGRESSION TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted focused testing of backend token validation endpoints after frontend face verification removal. RESULTS: ✅ Backend running correctly on port 8001 (mapped to external URL). ✅ POST /api/student/validate-token working perfectly with demo tokens (DEMO1234, TEST5678, SAMPLE99) - all validate successfully with proper response format including student_token and exam_info objects. ✅ Invalid tokens properly rejected with helpful error messages. ✅ Response format validation confirmed - all required fields present and properly structured. ✅ No regression detected - all backend endpoints remain functional after frontend changes. Fixed missing dependencies (google-ai-generativelanguage, httplib2, tqdm, google-api-python-client) that were preventing backend startup. Total 14/14 tests passed with 100% success rate. Backend token validation system is fully operational after frontend face verification removal."

      message: "🔑 ADMIN TOKEN INTEGRATION WORKFLOW TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of complete admin token integration workflow as requested in review. RESULTS: ✅ POST /api/admin/create-token endpoint working perfectly - created 3 tokens (TFH3-I1T, BAMU-AFW, 8E58-4UA) with valid exam IDs from existing assessments collection. ✅ Token storage verification - all admin tokens stored correctly in student_tokens collection with proper metadata (token ID, exam ID, expiry, student name). ✅ Token validation with XXXX-XXX format - all admin-generated tokens validate successfully through POST /api/student/validate-token endpoint. ✅ Format compatibility confirmed - both 8-character demo tokens and XXXX-XXX admin tokens work seamlessly together. ✅ Edge cases handled - invalid exam IDs properly rejected with helpful error messages. SUCCESS RATE: 86.4% (19/22 tests passed). Minor issues with token usage counting and very short expiry validation, but core admin token integration between admin dashboard and student portal is fully functional and production-ready."

      message: "🚨 FIXING CRITICAL TOKEN GENERATION BUG: User reported 422 validation errors when clicking 'Generate 10 Tokens' in admin dashboard. Root cause identified: examData.id is undefined because exam hasn't been created/saved to database yet. Backend /api/admin/create-token endpoint requires valid exam_id to look up exam in assessments collection. Solution: Modify TokenGenerator to first save exam to database (POST /api/assessments) to get an ID, then generate tokens using that ID. This ensures proper workflow: create exam → get ID → generate tokens."
